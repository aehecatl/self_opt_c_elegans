# self_opt_c_elegans
Self-optimization in a Hofpield Neural Network based on the connecotme of C. elegans as a directed multigraph with the option to run several experiments in parallel.

Embedded
Self-optimization in different C. elegans clusters monitored in the context of a
single experiment. 30% inhibitory neurons were added arbitrarily only to inter-cluster connections.

Isolated
Self-optimization in different C. elegans clusters with 30% inhibitory connections;
each panel was run separately (independent to the rest of the connectome).
